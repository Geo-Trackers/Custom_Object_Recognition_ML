# Machine Learning - Custom Aerial Image Recognition 
This repository contains a set of python scripts for creating a list of annotations based on the user defined bounding box on multiple set of images. This list of annotation files can thus be used for the training purpose using machine learning. 

Requirement: 
1. OpenCV
2. Python, Matplotlib
3. Darkflow(Open Source Neural Network Darknet in C translated to tensorflow) 
4. CUDA 

Thank you
